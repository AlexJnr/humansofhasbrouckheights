Most children would be excited about hearing that news. A lot of kids crave the companionship of a sibling and even go so far as asking their parents for one. Alejandra was quite the opposite. She said, “I did not want my sister. I wanted to be an only child. I wanted to be the only one and was upset. I didn’t want to share my parents' love and my room.”  There were some more genuine concerns as well. “I was very apprehensive about being a good sister, too,” she explained. For someone so young yet aware, it must have been nerve wracking knowing that she’d have a big influence on this person’s life. 
Her feelings on the matter stayed fairly consistent until one of the first doctor’s appointments. She said, “One day my parents took me out of school early, and we went to the hospital. My mom was having an ultrasound. I heard the heartbeat of my little sister and immediately fell in love.” That’s when the realization dawned on her. This was a real person that she would love and care about. A person that would be in her life forever and someone she could always rely on.

She knew it was about the beginning of a loving relationship that would last a lifetime.
She recalled back to when she had found out it was a girl. She explained, “I was so excited when I found out it would be a girl. I absolutely didn’t want a brother. Having a sister, I knew I would be able to relate to her. I thought we could end up as best friends.” She was able to imagine all the things that she wanted to do with her sister, everything she’d be able to teach her. It made her so excited knowing that she’d always have someone in her corner that would understand her and vice versa. 
On the day her sister was born, each of her family members took turns holding her. She watched and learned habits from each person on how to support a baby properly. She took mental notes as the adults supported the baby’s head and gently rocked her side to side. She longed for her chance to connect with her sister for the first time. Finally, after everyone had left it was Alejandra’s turn. She said, “After she was born, I was able to hold her and give her a bottle of milk.” This was when the bond was formed. Before Alejandra had been bonded to her sister, but now that bond was returned. Her relationship with her sister continues to develop and grow.<br></p></div><span class="backfill"></span></div><div class="post image-loaded" style="position: absolute; left: 930px; top: 0px;"><div class="post-image" style="height: 440px;"><img src="./Humans of HH_files/Brandon_collage.jpg" style="height: 440px;"></div><div class="post-text"><p>“My love for music began about a year ago once I watched the show Glee. I discovered myself singing more and more, whether it was in the shower, the kitchen, my room, and even during school. One funny story being, I belted a Lady Gaga song outside a museum while all my classmates stared in amazement. Then quarantine came and my passion for music and singing grew more than it ever had. I discovered many new artists and genres that I didn't even know I’d love. My friends and I would even go on walks just to blast music. It didn't matter if I didn't sing well. It's my escape from reality. Just get your headphones and drain out the noise. The songs were like comfort for me. I could listen to my favorite artists such as SZA, Jhene Aiko, Lorde, Frank Ocean, and Giveon all day long if I could. Their music has inspired me to pursue a life that revolved around music. I don't care about the fame, only making music that fits who I am and what I like. Any job like producing music or writing soundtracks for movies and shows would be a perfect fit for me. It's my passion and I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.”<br></p></div><span class="backfill"></span></div><div class="post image-loaded" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 1260px;"><div class="post-image" style="height: 440px;"><img src="./Humans of HH_files/Gia_collage.jpg" style="height: 440px;"></div><div class="post-text"><p>Gia Gyenes is an artist. She enjoys drawing, a hobby she’s picked up from her youth, 3rd grade to be exact. She’s recently begun painting as a pastime through the pandemic, but also cites her mothers drive through daily exercise throughout this time as an inspiration. Gia shares this athletic aspiration, but has yet to find the drive to succeed within it. I know most of us could level with that. The pandemic has also brought Gia and her younger sister closer. With an age gap of only 3 years, they’ve found a bond strengthened between the two. The impacts of quarantine seem to have begun shaping the young woman Gia is, yet she cites a different past, a different form of artistry and bond, as a stand out time/moment within her life. “The most impactful moment of my life was starting to dance. When I was two years old I took my first ballet class, like most kids do. But, I never grew out of dance, or moved on to another sport. Over the years I tried Karate, Basketball, and almost tried out for softball but none of them were for me. Even as I tried all these sports, I never stopped going to my dance lessons. I really enjoyed going to the classes and I learned many skills and made some of my best friends there. Around 12 years old I decided I wanted to take dance more seriously and attended more classes. Last year I even became a teacher at my studio and was able to teach the younger kids everything I've learned. I truly feel these past 14 years of dancing helped shape me into the person I am today.”<br></p></div><span class="backfill"></span></div><div class="post image-loaded" style="position: absolute; left: 465px; top: 1370px;"><div class="post-image" style="height: 440px;"><img src="./Humans of HH_files/Emily_collage1.jpg" style="height: 440px;"></div><div class="post-text"><p>(1/2) “I work at the Heights pool as a lifeguard. I coach the swim team and instruct swim lessons. Last summer, an old guy would always come in the lanes and yell at me during my classes. That continued throughout the entire summer, and it was really bothering me. The first incident happened when I was coaching some of the swim team kids in the afternoon. He was annoyed that they were in the lane because he wanted to use it. There was another time during one of my swim lessons with a little girl. I was teaching her how to swim laps. She was small—she was only six years old—so she needed me in the water to help her. Then, he started yelling at me that she shouldn’t be in the lap lane. I got out of the water, and I did not worry about it. Two weeks later, I had a lesson with two other kids—they were swimming laps. He yelled at me while I was teaching: ‘I can’t believe you get paid to have them swim back and forth.’ He continued screaming at me for some time, but I just decided to walk away. I am really involved at the pool between teaching swim lessons and all the swim team kids, so a lot of the people there know me. Many of them were coming up to me and defending me, trying to make me feel better about the situation. Many of the older women would even apologize to me at the pool: ‘We’re so sorry about him.’ That was very stressful. I was a sixteen-year-old girl being screamed at by this old man repeatedly, and I didn’t talk to my friends about this because it was my job.”<br></p></div><span class="backfill"></span></div><div class="post image-loaded" style="position: absolute; left: 930px; top: 1200px;"><div class="post-image" style="height: 440px;"><img src="./Humans of HH_files/Emily_collage2.jpg" style="height: 440px;"></div><div class="post-text"><p>(2/2) “They say, ‘the customer is always right,’ and he was a member, so I just focused on the kids. I knew how to help them develop stamina and understand what they were doing in the water. For example, I made them understand buoyancy. They obviously did not know it as ‘buoyancy.’ Still, I had kindergarteners explaining to me the different positions which would make them either sink or float. It is important for safety, and working at the pool brings me so much joy. Initially, the incidents seriously upset me. At the same time, however, having to stand up to them taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes, it is better to walk away from such undesirable situations and focus on doing what you know is right. In my case, that meant continuing to teach the kids how to swim. While all of that girl’s friends were able to swim really well, she couldn’t even float on her back at the beginning of that summer, but she was working very hard. Just the fact that I was finally getting her to swim laps made me focus on how I was helping somebody. She adored being with me, too. Whenever I was sitting in the lifeguard chair, she would come in front of me, showing off that she was practicing—I thought it was the cutest thing in the world. I did not see the man this summer. Eventually, I realized that his comments did not matter to me, and I just cared about helping the kids become better swimmers. They were just adorable, and they are the reason I love working at the pool.”<br></p></div><span class="backfill"></span></div><div class="post image-loaded" style="position: absolute; left: 465px; top: 2850px;"><div class="post-image" style="height: 440px;"><img src="./Humans of HH_files/Sophie_collage.jpg" style="height: 440px;"></div><div class="post-text"><p>“I grew up loving animals and I watched my family travel all over the world. My grandma visited many different countries and went on tons of safari trips. She always brought back pictures of animals close up. She even held baby animals like monkeys, tigers, and elephants. That’s why I want to pursue a career with animals involved. I’ve gone to the zoo a lot and I love watching videos of animals. I find it so interesting how monkeys are so intelligent and I just love everything about them. I just want to travel and work with so many different animals. A job involving animals would be amazing. It wouldn’t even be a job, you know? Like yes, it’s a job but I’d rather work doing something I love then have a job I hate for the sake of making money. I’m just very passionate about animals and the environment. If I don’t work with animals, I want to be an environmental scientist because I find that field extremely interesting.”<br></p></div><span class="backfill"></span></div><div class="post image-loaded" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 2750px;"><div class="post-image" style="height: 440px;"><img src="./Humans of HH_files/Nick_collage.jpg" style="height: 440px;"></div><div class="post-text"><p>“I enjoy writing to create worlds and characters that other people would never otherwise imagine. An idea pops into my head, it goes to paper. There’s so much fun to be had in creating worlds that I feel like I’m missing out when I’m not creating.” Nick is a very strong writer and ironically it's also his favorite hobby. He explained to me that , “I enjoy writing to create worlds and characters that other people would never otherwise imagine.” I could agree on this because I've heard his writing first hand. When Nick reads his stories in class, they have very good descriptions and everything flows from one sentence to another. When asking the next question, “Where do you see yourself in 10 years?”, Nick said that he wanted to pursue a writing career. “My dreams have always been involved with jobs in the film and writing industry and I think it would be beyond amazing if I can find success in that career branch, especially because it’s so hard to get into.” Although he has many options of careers he'd like to do in life, he wants to make sure it's a job he can enjoy. On top of having a writing career, Nick also has other plans for his future. “Other than success in the workforce, I’d of course love to have a small family of sorts by the time I'm 27 to 28 years old. I think that’s a pretty decent time to start one.”<br></p></div><span class="backfill"></span></div><div class="post image-loaded" style="position: absolute; left: 930px; top: 2650px;"><div class="post-image" style="height: 440px;"><img src="./Humans of HH_files/Aidan_collage.jpg" style="height: 440px;"></div><div class="post-text"><p>His favorite vacation was one where he went on his second cruise. He said, “I liked the freedom I had to do whatever I want whenever I wanted.” He was at the age where he was allowed to wander around the cruise ship freely by himself. “I loved all of it.”, he stated. From breakfast, to dinner, to going in the pool, to ordering things at the bar, it was great. The pool on the ship was where he spent much of his time. He liked it there. 
  He said of the pool, “It was great, there was a bar next to the pool, and some slides.” This was great because while he was in the pool he could just order drinks. Then he would just sit in the pool, relax, and sip away. Another thing he said he did was, “I like sat by the pool a lot, you know, just enjoying my surroundings.” The light breeze, the beautiful ocean all around him, the sun beating down on him it was all great. He liked going on the water slides into the pool and said that it was a lot of fun. 
  He said, “Being on the cruise was really relaxing.” I can imagine it was, just sitting in the pool all day. He can remember how the sun glinted off the water as they sailed through open waters. “The days on that cruise were some of my favorite.” This was because of the freedom he was granted and who he went on the trip with. He said he was only with his parents but that was all he needed to enjoy his time there.

Though he didn’t share any stories with me, there are a few interesting things about him as a person that were rather surprising. One such fact being that he has no pets whatsoever. No dogs, no cats, no birds, nothing of the sort. In fact, he doesn't even like pets in general, and it is a completely personal choice. He told me, “I just don’t get why people have pets, I’m just not into the idea.” “Why are you not into getting pets?” I asked with great curiosity. He gave me the same answer as before, but if he had a story to share, it would probably be something like this. “One time, I was going to take out the trash, like any other day. What I didn’t expect was a rabid dog rummaging through the garbage. Thankfully I managed to fend it off with the trash bag itself and get back in the house. It may not sound like much, but the incident really turned me away from the idea of owning a pet.”<br></p></div><span class="backfill"></span></div><div class="post image-loaded" style="position: absolute; left: 930px; top: 4020px;"><div class="post-image" style="height: 440px;"><img src="./Humans of HH_files/Mia_collage.jpg" style="height: 440px;"></div><div class="post-text"><p>I asked “What were the most memorable of your family vacations can you recall?”

Mia said, “The most memorable of my family vacations was my trip to Aruba last summer. My family had been to Aruba twice before so this time we went with family friends. We were staying at the same hotel so we were waiting in the lounge area to get picked up by a cab. Me, my sisters, and our friend were playing behind the reception area because no one was there. One of the workers walked by and told us to get out so we did. My one sister didn’t hear so the worker got really mad. My dad started to yell at the guy and ask him what his problem is because we were just playing. My dad got really fat and was ready to fight the guy. We held back my dad and my dad went to the manager and got a deal on our trip because of the man. To this day we still crack up about it. It was also super memorable because it was the first time I had been back to Aruba since I was a little girl. When I was little Aruba was the first place I had been that was out of the country. I always liked to look at old photos of me there and I had faint memories of Aruba but when I went back it was so fun because I could finally remember one of these trips.”

Afterwards, I asked “Are you involved in your culture?” 

She responded “I am not very involved in my culture because I have lots of different backgrounds. I am Italian, German, Irish, Scottish, and even more things, but because I don’t have a main culture I am not really involved in any of them. I think it is so cool when people are involved in their culture and do activities that involve it, I wish that I had something cool like that.”

For my final question, I asked “Do you have a sibling bond?”

She said “Me and my siblings have a great bond and I wouldn’t change it for the world. I know it is cliche but I really do consider them my best friends. If I had no one else left I know that they would be there for me and they always have my back. There have been so many times where both of my sisters have stuck up for me in different situations. They can always make me laugh and we just always have the best times together. When we were in quarantine me and my sisters could only hang out with each other because we couldn’t go out. We played so many games and I would have been bored out of my mind without them.”

He has built a number of basic machines over the years with his knowledge of mechanical engineering. Mr. Von Seidelmann has been working on entering this field for years. Although more recently, he has been having second thoughts about entering the field of mechanical engineering. He told me himself “apparently it doesn’t pay well so I think I’ll do something else.” Wherever he goes in life, he will surely be successful at it.
Mr. Von Seidelmann is also an avid video game player. The kinds of games he plays, I do not know. Though he did state that it was merely a hobby compared to his other work. As far as his skills in games, I am uncertain. If he were to tell me a story about his time gaming, it would most likely be rather plain. In his words, “I just game for fun, I don’t really care that much about being the best at it.”
One main hobby of Mr. Von Seidelmann is baseball. In fact, he has played baseball for many years up to this point. He has many years of experience in the game, having played it since he was younger. Although, he didn’t have any particular story to tell, but if he did have one it would be like something you would see in a movie. “Ok so there was one person on every base, it was the last inning of the game, I had to get this homerun. We were only down by four points, I needed to get this grand slam. The ball was coming right at me and everything seemed like it was in slow-motion. I clenched my teeth, closed my eyes, and swung my bat. After a loud “Crack!” I saw the ball go flying out of the park and over the fence. I did it, I won the game for the team.”<br></p></div><span class="backfill"></span></div>

It wasn’t the most eventful trip but while we drove there, a 2 hour and 30 min drive, we talked about many things that I can still remember to this day. Some of these things push me to try harder in school and some push me to be a better person. When we reached Montauk, the view was incredible and the cliffs on the edge were tall. The ocean breeze was refreshing.”<br>“Where do you see yourself in 10 years?”<br>“I can see myself with a job in the engineering field because that is always what I liked when I was little. I think I would either stay in NJ or move to somewhere less busy and more settled down. I want to stay close to friends and family but finding new friends in another place doesn't sound too bad.”

I have one sibling and that's my brother. I love my brother and he's always got my back just like I always got his. I don't currently own any pets but I previously owned two goldfishes. A few things that I like to do on the weekends would have to be, play instruments, play video games, watch anime, draw and eat. Whenever I'm hungry my go-to meal would most likely have to be pasta. Someone I look up to is without a doubt my mom which is why I always tend to do my best to always make her and my family proud. I hope to make that happen by being able to take care of myself and have an amazing family of my own.”
